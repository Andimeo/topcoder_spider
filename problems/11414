              		<table><tr><td colspan="2" class="statText"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td class="statText">    </td><td class="statText">There is a group of N people numbered from 0 to N-1. Each of them is either an honest person or a liar. You wish to know how many liars are in the group. To do this, you have asked the same question to every person in the group: "What is the number of liars in this group?". The people in the group themselves know the exact number of liars, but since you are a foreigner in the group, they have not told it to you exactly. Instead, the i-th person answered you as follows: <i>"There are at least </i><b>claim</b>[i] <i>liars in the group."</i> It is known that statements by honest persons are always true. However, statements by liars are <i>always</i> false. So, if a liar claims that there are at least X liars in the group, then in fact there are less than X liars.<br><br>
Now, given a int[] <b>claim</b> containing the N answers that you received, you would like to determine the number of liars in the group. Unfortunately, there's another twist that makes this problem more complicated.  The people in the group speak a different language than you, so you might have misunderstood some of their answers.  The answers in <b>claim</b> are how you understood them, but they might not match what the people actually told you. If you definitely misunderstood at least one of the answers, return -1. Otherwise, assuming that you understood all answers correctly, return the minimum number of liars that could be in the group.
