In a certain board game, there are 40 numbered squares arranged around the board as shown above. The players alternate
turns. On each turn a player rolls 2 six-sided dice and moves forward (clockwise) the sum of the
two values. If he lands on square 7, 22, or 36 he draws a card which may direct him
to move forward to a specified square or to "go to jail". There are 20 cards, and  after a card has been drawn it is replaced and the cards are reshuffled: <ul><li>
    2 cards say "go to jail" </li><li>
    1 card  says "go to square 11"</li><li>
    1 card says "go to square 24"</li><li>
    1 card says "go to square 29"</li><li>
    1 card says "go to square 39"</li><li>
    14 cards don't cause him to move </li></ul><p>
If he has not gone to jail and has rolled "doubles" (the 2 dice have the same value) he 
continues his turn by rolling again and behaving as before. However, if he rolls doubles 
3 times on one turn, he does not move the amount shown on the third roll -- instead 
he "goes to jail".
The player's turn ends after he moves on a roll that was not doubles, or when he goes to jail.
</p><p>
One additional rule is that if a player lands on square 30, his turn ends after that move and he goes to jail.
</p><p>
We want to analyze the beginning of a 2 player game. Both players start on square 0. We will pretend that a
player is removed from the game when he goes to jail or when he gets past square 39 (possibly
by being directed to move by a card). So if a card directs a player to a lower numbered square, the player is
removed from the game before landing on that square. If a card directs a player to a higher numbered square, he
has landed on both the square where he drew the card and on the square he was directed to.
</p><p>

 For a particular square we want to know the probability that the 2nd player will land on it without
having the first player land on it earlier. Create a class Monopolies that contains a method
probability the is given <b>square</b> and that returns the desired probability.

   No player can land on square 1 on his first time around the board, since the smallest
   possible roll causes a player to move 2 squares forward.
